100 post and an admin is created via seed with the credentials:

email: "admin1@therialnews.com"
password: "Th3r14lp455w0rd"
role: 1 (Administrator)

Sorry for the poor delivery... I didn´t have enough time to develop something better for now, comments aren't linked to the posts yet... andI´m able to deploy on render due the similarities on databases (https://therialnews-mbgu.onrender.com/)
